# airbnb-clone-project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

# Key highlights of the project

Team role documentation
Exploring the technologies used in scalable projects and their specific contributions to achieving project goals
Feature-driven development
API Security Fundamentals
CI/CD Pipeline integration

# Team Roles
1. **Backend Developer**: responsible for implementing API endpoints , database schemans and business logic
2. **Database Administrator**" : Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
3. **DevOps Engineer**: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
4. **QA Engineer**: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

#Technology Stack
**Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
**Django REST Framework**: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
**PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database used for data storage
**GraphQL**: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
**Celery**: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
**Redis**: Used for caching and session management.
**Docker**: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
**CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

#Database Design
These are the functionalities our database will be helping us with
**Users**
We want to be able to: 
list all users of the system
create new users
retrieve a specific user
update a specific user 
delete a specific user 

**Properties**
List all the propertites
Create a new property 
Retrieve a specific property 
Delete a specific property
update a specific property

**bookings**
List all the bookings
Create a new booking 
Retrieve a specific booking
Delete a specific booking
update a specific booking

**Reviews**
List all reviews
Create a new review 
Retrieve a specific review 
Delete a specific review
update a specific review

**Payments**
Process payments

#Feature Breakdown
**API Documentation**: OpenAPI Standard: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
Django REST Framework: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.
**User Authentication**: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
**Property Management**: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
**Booking System**: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
**Payment Processing**: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
**Review System**: Post and manage reviews for properties.
**Database Optimizations**: Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

#API Security
Some of the security measures and the importance of using them
**Authentication**: Verifies user identity to ensure only registered users access accounts and services.
**Authorization**:To Restricts access to resources based on user roles
**Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting requests from the same user or IP
**User Data Protection**: Encrypts and secures personal data to prevent leaks and unauthorised access
**Payment Security**: Uses secure payment gateways and encryption to protect financial transactions.
